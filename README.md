# Fupma - Full PHP MVC Architeture

Fupma is a PHP-based mini framework, designed to simplify the use of MVC architecture. The idea is a fast and organized style to generate pages and modules on a fast reading platform. Fupma's structure and folders can also be easily modified in the configuration files.

At present, only I (Daniel Fiedler) contributes regularly to the project. If you are interested in helping the development, please contact me.
